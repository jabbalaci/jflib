Why the .F90 extension?
=======================

Why .F90 and not the .f90 extension?

With .F90, the CPP pre-processor runs through the code,
allowing the usage of these macros:

    call assert(to_str(2025) == "2026", "oops", __FILE__, __LINE__)  ! fail

With .f90, we would get an error at these macros: __FILE__, __LINE__

Don't forget to add these lines to fpm.toml:

[preprocess]
[preprocess.cpp]
suffixes = [".F90", ".f90"]
